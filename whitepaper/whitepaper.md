# Decentralized AI Whitepaper

## Intro

WARNING : this a student project and has to be taken as his, without any warranty of any kind. Use at you own risk.

This is our final project for [TheSchool.AI](https://www.theschool.ai), a decentralized application course by Siraj Raval.
This Whitepaper is ispired by the one from iExec
We talk a lot of iExec because it is the core technology we use for our project.
But we have no link or affiliation of any kind with iExec.

## BLUEPRINT FOR DECENTRALIZED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Big tech companies are leading AI these days. They use AI in more and more functionality in every application. For example Photoshop now use deep learning to separate subject from background.
Things like that is really difficult for open source software because even with engineer willing to add such functionality they don't have the Data. Data is the currency of this century. And we give them for free to these company to allow them to sell us product in return !
That is a non-sense. We all deserve to keep our data safe and be able to monetize or give them to who we want.
The leading technology for AI is Deep Learning, the concept is simple : just send millions of data with associated label (example : a picture of a cat with label "cat") to a computer program that will learn by itself to identify a cat when he saw one.
So there is three challenges :
- Having millions of data with label
- Having the computing power to train these algorithms
- Democratize the use of AI

Our contribution with this project is to address these points, beginning by the last.
Allowing anyone to compute Deep Learning algorithms with less knowledge as possible.

## BACKGROUND

Our project is build around iExec and IPFS.
IPFS means Iner-Planetary FileSystem. It's a way to share files in a peer-to-peer way.
It work perfectly well but lack of a way to incentives poeple to keep files online. FileCoin aim at doing this soon.
iExec goal is to allow off-chain computation in a decentralized way. Anybody could share his computer power and get RLC token in return. In the future, datasets could also be sold on the network.
iExec just release is testnet last week so it is more challenging to use it. For example there is only company worker to execute task so when they are stopped we have no way to work on our project.

## CURRENT LIMITATIONS
### Blockchain computing challenges
### traditional computing infrastructure challenges
## OUR SOLUTION
### technical overview
### core value proposition
### key technological advancements
## MARKET OPPORTUNITY  
### the perfect timing for go-to-market

Privacy is no more a cypherpunk concept, it is a mainstream subject with GDPR and Facebook numerous leaks.
More and more poeple saw there data as valuable and meaningful.

### the Blockchain market

Blockchain is more challenging, most poeple sees it only like a crypto-currency and not like an other way to do computing.

### the dapps market
### the traditional cloud market
### the edge and fog computing market
### competitive landscape
## BUSINESS USE CASE
## TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
### Background: desktop grid computing
### proof-of-contriBution
### consensus protocols
### the need for poco
### the role of poco within the iexec platform
### domain specific sidechain
### iExec smart contracts: matchmaking
### iExec smart contracts: multi-criteria scheduling
## THE MARKETPLACE FOR CLOUD RESOURCES
### the cloud computing marketplace
### cloud computing as a commodity
### workers pools
### the iexec marketplace
### pay-per-task (ppt)
### the dapp store
### the data marketplace
## ROADMAP
Our goal will be achieve when global warming was ended.
## FINANCIALS
### costs
We have no cost, we do it on our part time and kind peoples give us computing power on testnet.
### token sale
We do not plan to made an ICO because we believe in Humanity to contribute to help us in our goal.
We took a small fee on every transaction made using our Dapp to allow the team to go to Las Vegas and get drunk once a week.
